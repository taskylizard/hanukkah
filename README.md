## Day 2

We're finding orders that contain bagels, coffee, and cleaning supplies.

There's two SKUs for bagels, one for coffee, and one for Rug Cleaner:

```shell
Œª cat data/noahs-products.jsonl | rg -i bagel
{"sku": "BKY1573", "desc": "Sesame Bagel", "wholesale_cost": 1.02, "dims_cm": [11.9, 4.7, 0.9]}
{"sku": "BKY5717", "desc": "Caraway Bagel", "wholesale_cost": 1.03, "dims_cm": [11.3, 2.3, 1.6]}
Œª cat data/noahs-products.jsonl | rg -i coffee
{"sku": "DLI8820", "desc": "Coffee, Drip", "wholesale_cost": 1.44, "dims_cm": [9.6, 7.8, 0.7]}
Œª cat data/noahs-products.jsonl | rg -i clean
{"sku": "HOM2761", "desc": "Rug Cleaner", "wholesale_cost": 1.43, "dims_cm": [19.6, 11.7, 0.2]}
```

Find all of the orders that have those 3 things (coffee, cleaner, and either of the bagels), then map the order's customer ID to the customer record.

The person is from the same neighborhood as the contract cleaner, so their city should be `Jamaica`.
